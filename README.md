This program is a Python-based tool designed to perform shielding calculations for linear accelerator (Linac) rooms. It calculates workloads and designs shielding thicknesses for radiation protection in radiotherapy facilities. The tool helps medical physicists determine shielding requirements based on workload and energy parameters.
